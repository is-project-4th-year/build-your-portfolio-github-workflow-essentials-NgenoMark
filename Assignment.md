## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

**1**
Based on the tutorials we had done in class i thought everything would be easy.


What you thought it would be like **(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**

What you actually learned **(Reality ðŸ˜…)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project ðŸ’»

make it honestâ€”and if it surprised you, even better!

Example format:

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big appsâ€”nothing Iâ€™d need for a small project.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

The above image shows my Project Board(Mark's Portfolio).
It classifies all issues into ToDo, In Progress and Done.
I ccan clearly track what to do and how to keep oneself accountable from the project board.




### C. Branching

- Screenshot showing your branch list with meaningful naming.




### D. Pull Requests

The image above displays a pull request linked specifically to the contact section, this was the last section being worked on and immediately after completion a pull request was created to keep the main branch up to date. 




### E. Merge Conflict Resolution

The above image shows a merge conflict expereience while working on issue to add the project section.
Several lines had overlapped and we had an issue in trying to resolve in github because the feature to show the conflicts was not present and thus it took a lot of time to understand what had overlapped.
